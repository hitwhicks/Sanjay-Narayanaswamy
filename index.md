## About Me

Currently working on "Exploring Natural Variation of Flowering Time Networks" for my Master Thesis at [Gregor Mendel Institute](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/gmi/). The work involves looking at the effect of allelic variation of Flowering Time GWAS candidates ([The 1001genomes Consortium](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4949382/)), on the 'Flowering Time' Network in Arabidopsis thaliana.
