## About Me

Currently working on "Exploring Natural Variation of Flowering Time Networks" for my Master Thesis at [Gregor Mendel Institute](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/gmi/) (Nordborg Group). The work involves looking at the effect of allelic variation of Flowering Time GWAS candidates ([The 1001genomes Consortium](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4949382/)), on the 'Flowering Time' Network in *Arabidopsis thaliana*. This thesis is being carried out under the [Evolutionary Systems Biology](https://evolsysbio.univie.ac.at/) Masters Program at [Uni Wien](https://www.univie.ac.at/en/).
